# "Spinning Awards" — New England Conservatory of Music
### Public interactive installation that showcases almnus music awards and musicians

## Summary from <a href="http://www.informationinaction.com/spinning-awards/">Information in Action</a>
Spinning Awards is an interactive and improvisational visualization that makes 150 years of musical awards won by alumni from the New England Conservatory (NEC) accessible through the flick of a finger. The project is a permanent installation at NEC’s new Student Life and Performance Center in Boston.

“Spinning Awards” consists in a matrix of 45 digital cards that each showcase one of NEC’s many award winners. A tap on each of the cards reveals more information about the award. A swipe over the cards, instead, generates a digital wind that twirls the cards revealing new awards at every spin. The project is an improvisational interface based on Kristian Kloeckl’s research on an improvisation-based framework for design."
